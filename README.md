Home made Xmas tree using Adafruit's LED Strip: http://www.adafruit.com/products/306

Lot's of credits for the code:
* Ladyada - main driver, and some programs (https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806)
* Digital Misery/Sowbug - Program choosing (https://github.com/sowbug/G35Arduino & http://www.digitalmisery.com/projects/colornode/)
* happyinmotion - simplex noise program (http://happyinmotion.livejournal.com/278357.html)
* Colour Scheme Designer website for some colours (http://colorschemedesigner.com/)
* The Random Strobe, Colour phasing and the unused Oscillate are my own.

Each program has multiple patterns, which are usually variations on the colour scheme.

It requires push buttons to be wired up:
A0 - Program +
A1 - Program -
A2 - Variation +
A3 - Variation -
A9 - Toggle Random (changes program and variation randomly every couple of minutes)
A10 - Toggle Off/On (really just sets lights to 0,0,0)
